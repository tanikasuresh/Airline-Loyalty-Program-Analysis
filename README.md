## Analyzing the Data

1) What are the number of Active and Former members for each membership type within the Loyalty Program? 
```sql
SELECT Loyalty_Card, CASE
WHEN Cancellation_Month IS NULL AND Cancellation_Year IS NULL THEN 'Active'
ELSE 'Cancelled' END AS 'Status', COUNT(*) AS Member_Count FROM customer_loyalty_history
GROUP BY Loyalty_Card, status
ORDER BY Member_Count DESC;
```

2) What are the number of members (both Active and Former) that enrolled in the Loyalty Program under the Standard Enrollment or during the 2018 Promotion for each membership type?
```sql
SELECT Loyalty_Card, Enrollment_Type, COUNT(*) AS Member_Count FROM customer_loyalty_history
GROUP BY Loyalty_Card, Enrollment_Type
ORDER BY Member_Count DESC;
```

3) What are the number of enrollments and cancellations for each year?
```sql
SELECT enrollment_year AS Year, COUNT(enrollment_year) AS Number_of_Enrollments, COUNT(Cancellation_Year)
AS Number_of_Cancellations FROM customer_loyalty_history
GROUP BY Enrollment_Year
ORDER BY Year;
```

4) What was the number of enrollments during the 2018 Promotion Period and how did it differ from the number of enrollments during the same months in previous years?
```sql
SELECT '2018 Promotion (Feb - Apr)' AS Period, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Enrollments FROM customer_loyalty_history
WHERE Enrollment_Type = '2018 Promotion'
UNION
SELECT 'Average for Previous Years (Feb - Apr)' AS Period, ROUND(AVG(Number_of_Enrollments)) AS Average_Enrollment
FROM (SELECT Enrollment_Year, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Enrollments FROM customer_loyalty_history
WHERE Enrollment_Year BETWEEN '2013' AND '2017' AND Enrollment_Month BETWEEN 2 AND 4
GROUP BY Enrollment_Year) AS X;
```

5) What is the average Customer Lifetime Value for different combinations of demographics (Gender, Education, Marital Status)?
```sql
SELECT Gender, Education, Marital_Status, CONCAT('$',FORMAT(Average_CLV,2)) AS Average_CLV FROM
(SELECT Gender, Education, Marital_Status, AVG(CLV) AS Average_CLV FROM customer_loyalty_history
GROUP BY Gender, Education, Marital_Status
ORDER BY Average_CLV DESC) AS X;
```

6) What is the average number of flights for each combination of demogrpahics (Gender, Education, Marital Status)?
```sql
SELECT Gender, Education, Marital_Status, ROUND(AVG(Total_Flights)) AS Average_Flights
FROM (SELECT f.Loyalty_Number, Gender, Education, Marital_Status, SUM(Total_Flights) AS Total_Flights
FROM customer_flight_activity f
INNER JOIN customer_loyalty_history l ON f.Loyalty_Number=l.Loyalty_Number
GROUP BY f.Loyalty_Number, Gender, Education, Marital_Status) AS X
GROUP BY Gender, Education, Marital_Status
ORDER BY Average_Flights DESC;
```

7) Of the members who cancelled their enrollment, how many and how long were the former members in the program?
```sql
WITH cancelled_members AS
(
SELECT * FROM customer_loyalty_history
WHERE cancellation_year IS NOT NULL AND cancellation_month IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT cancellation_year - enrollment_year AS Years_Enrolled, count(*) AS Member_Count FROM cancelled_members
GROUP BY Years_Enrolled
ORDER BY Member_Count DESC;
```

8) How many members joined prior to 2017 but have not booked any flights in 2017 and 2018?
```sql
WITH active_no_annual_flights AS
(
SELECT f.loyalty_number, year, sum(total_flights) AS flights FROM customer_flight_activity f
INNER JOIN customer_loyalty_history l ON l.loyalty_number=f.loyalty_number
WHERE cancellation_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY f.loyalty_number, year
HAVING flights = 0
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Member_Count FROM (SELECT n.loyalty_number, count(*) as years_of_inactivity FROM active_no_annual_flights n
INNER JOIN customer_loyalty_history c ON c.loyalty_number=n.loyalty_number
WHERE enrollment_year < 2017
GROUP BY n.loyalty_number
HAVING years_of_inactivity = 2) AS X;
```
